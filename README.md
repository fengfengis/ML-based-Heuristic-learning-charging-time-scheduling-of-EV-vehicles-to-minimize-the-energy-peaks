# ML-based-Heuristic-learning-charging-time-scheduling-of-EV-vehicles-to-minimize-the-energy-peaks
The python code generated random demands of random EV vehicles and household electricity demands. 
It then plots the graphs between earlier energy peaks and reductions in peaks after the implementation of the algorithm.
The main concern of the project is to minimize the peaks(high electricity demands) in electricity demands by scheduling the EV charging by using Heuristic learning approach and minimizing the cost of charging. Priorities are also considered along with other factors.
